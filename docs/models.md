# Further Models
TopoPyScale include a number of export tools compatible with some established energy and mass balance models for snow and permafrost physics. TopoPyScale allows downscaling forcing timeseries relevant for those models.

The file `topo_sim.py` is a collection of functions to interact directly with some of these models from within Python.

## Snowmodel
Snowmodel, written by Glen Liston, is snow model focused on wind redistribution. 

## CROCUS
CROCUS is a 1D physical model developed by Meteo France to simulate the evolution of snowpack state variables and snow metamorphic path.
