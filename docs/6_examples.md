# Examples

A set of examples on how to use TopoPyScale is available (here)[https://github.com/ArcticSnow/TopoPyScale_examples]. The examples are ready to use with preset configurations and a Digital Elevation Model. A working Python VE is required as well as the `cdsapi` credentials (setup)[1_instal/#setting-up-cdsapi]. When the example is run, it will first request the climate data from CDS which may take time (multiple hours). Keep the terminal open or use a (screen)[https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/] session.
