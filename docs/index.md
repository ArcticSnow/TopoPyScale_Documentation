# Welcome to TopoPyScale

TopoPyScale is a downscaling method for global and regional climate model datasets, particularly relevant to mountain ranges, and hillslopes.

If you are here to use TopoPyScale, then head to the Quick Start page. Further configuration setup are explained in detail

## General Concept

TopoPyScale uses both climate model/reanalysis data and Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for correcting atmospheric state variables (e.g. temperature, pressure, humidity, *etc*). TopoPyScale provides tools to interpolate and correct such variables to be relevant locally given a topographical context.

## Funding and Support

TopoPyScale is currently developed by scientists at:

- [University of Oslo](https://www.mn.uio.no/geo/english/), Norway
- SLF, Switzerland
